# KAPy
Klimaatlas in Python

KAPy is a ground-up python-based rethink of the original Klimaatlas Denmark pipeline. The goal of KAPy is to create an open-source and flexible framework that can be used to generate Klimaatlas-like analyses anywhere in the world, from both CMIP and CORDEX datasets.

## Why KAPy?

KAPy takes its name from joining the KA from Klimaatlas [www.klimaatlas.dk] with the Py from Python, in the style of many Python libraries. But more importantly, the name is also a homonym for the phrase *ka pai*, taken from the language of the Maori people, the *tangata whenua* (indigenous people) of Aotearoa New Zealand. The phrase means simply "good", and can also be used as praise, as in "well done".
