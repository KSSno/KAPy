# Basic configuration file
#---------------------------
# This configuration file is intended to be used as a basic example and test
# dataset for the KAPy suite. It is loosely based on the configuration used in the
# Ghana Climate Atlas, but with simplifications to make it run faster. Sample datasets
# can be downloaded from https://download.dmi.dk/Research_Projects/KAPy/
