# Tutorial 00 - Data download with esgpull

## Goal

To familiarise yourself with how to download climate model data of interest using the esgpull approach.

## Point of departure

This provides a quick standardised way of downloading climate model data which can then be used in the KAPy for processing. This is part of the data preprocessing stage used in KAPy.

## Instructions
1. The first thing you need before starting the download process using esgpull is to make sure that esgpull is well installed, and configured and that you have set up authentification cedentials for one of the ESGF nodes where the data will be sourced. This process is explained in Tutorial ***. 
2. Check if esgpull is set up well, configured well and if it is ready to be used for data discovery and data download. You can use the following command which checks the esgpull version
   
```
esgpull -V
```
