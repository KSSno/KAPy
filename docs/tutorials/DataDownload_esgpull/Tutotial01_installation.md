Next, we need to setup the Python environment, containing the packages used by KAPy. Add-on libraries in Python are referred to as "packages" and their installation is maintained by a package manager, of which there are many to choose from (e.g. Anaconda, Conda, Miniconda, Mamba, Micromamba etc). The example code given here is for the Conda package manager - you can download it from https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html if you don't have it already, but KAPy should work just as well with other package managers. The examples are also for a Linux environment - however, a similar approach will hold if you want to try and get KAPy running in Windows.
